Email Validation with DB
Application that asks a user to enter an email address and validates whether that email exists within the database.
If the email address is not valid, have a notification "Email is not valid!" to display on the homepage.
Once a valid email address is entered, save to the database the email address the user entered. On the success page, display all the email addresses entered along with the date and the time when the email addresses were entered
